      My biggest goal as an Engineer is to never stop learning, and work on cool
      stuff. Here's a couple of things I'm good at:

        <h4 className="hover_effect">Fast Learner</h4>
        <p>
          Through my career I have been on a never ending quest to learn new
          things that excites me and feels fresh. In the Software side of the
          river this is great because new tools and frameworks are coming out
          very frequently. Bringing me onto the team you get someone who think
          it's a privilege to get into new waters and will jump at the
          opportunity to do something new.

      <Col>
        <h4 className="hover_effect">Communication</h4>
        <p>
          During my 4 years of working in a high responsibility position I
          learnt the value of clear and concise exchange of information. Many
          meetings in my career were just wasted on missunderstandings and
          useless talking about things that was not related to getting the work
          done. I absolutely hate wasting time, and as such, clear concise and
          structured communication is religion.

        <h4 className="hover_effect">True Technologist</h4>
        <p>
          With a Msc. in Electrical Engineering and 4 years working experience
          as an Electronics Engineer in Hardware Development, I am someone who
          know the whole chain that makes up a computer. It is important to
          bring in as many perspectives in a project as possible, and with me
          you will have someone who can think from the Silicon structures,
          through the machine code, Asembly code and up to the top level fluffy
          stuff like JavaScript.
        </p>
      </Col>
      <Col>
        <h4 className="hover_effect">Getting Things done</h4>
        <p>
          I absolutely hate wasting time on endless discussions that does not
          bring any real value. I have seen the impact on a project who dives
          too deep into the details and, as we all know, it's not pretty. I am a
          big practitioner of ToDo-Lists, Kanban, Agile/Scrum Methodologies and
          anything else that might elevate productivity levels. Let's face it,
          our brains are lazy. It needs dicipline to trick our brains to keep
          delivering, and I like to keep the momentum up!

      I'm constantly experimenting with new things, give me a follow or join the
      fun through the magic of open-source on GitHub.
