              I currently live on two opposite ends of the world, standing with
              one foot in my home country of Sweden, and the other in my wife's
              country, China. I want to build things that are new, refreshing,
              and makes a difference for others. I really enjoy solving tough
              problems.
              <br />
              <br />
              Education wise I hold a MSc. in Electrical Engineering: Design of
              Processors and Integrated Systems and what many people might not
              realize is that it’s actually a software degree, with VHDL as the
              main language. The difference is that VHDL code becomes transistor
              structures on silicon making up the chips, compared to other
              higher level code becomes instructions for the chips themselves. I
              took extra courses in JAVA, and scaled software development
              practices and did a minor in Software Engineering. I am convinced
              knowing the whole chain from electron to screen render makes me
              write better code.
              <br />
              <br />
              Right out of university I was soon becoming a father, and I got an
              offer to take up the role as an electronics engineer at a stable
              local company. Needless to say, it was a great start, the work was
              rewarding and I was learning brand new things everyday. 3.5 years
              down the line I decided to make a change, I realized that I wanted
              to change direction into Software Engineering.
              <br />
              <br />
              Fast forward: This year in January my son turned 3 years old, I
              quit my job and moved back to China with my wife to her home city
              of Hangzhou, we were missing the fast paced life, and I had to
              make my change before getting too comfortable in something I’m not
              passionate about.

              Scale: During a project my designs were to be produced in several
              thousands units monthly, if not properly tested for large scale
              production it would have cost the company vast amounts of money in
              several different ways. This means I know the importance of
              testing, maintainability, and how things tend to go when things go
              big.
